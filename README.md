# Notification System with JavaScript

This repository hosts a versatile notification system built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system allows for the seamless integration of dynamic notifications into web applications, providing essential feedback to users in response to various events or actions.

## Features:

- **Dynamic Notification Creation:** Notifications are created dynamically based on user actions (button clicks) using JavaScript.
- **Notification Types:** Three types of notifications are supported: Success, Error, and Invalid.
- **Customizable Styles:** Each notification type has its own styling to differentiate between them visually.
- **Automatic Removal:** Notifications are automatically removed after a certain period to prevent cluttering the interface.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Click on the buttons to trigger different types of notifications.
4. Notifications will appear dynamically and disappear automatically after a few seconds.

Feel free to customize the notification styles and behaviors according to your needs.
